<b>JavaScript and Python Dev Tool Behaviors 1.0</b>
<br><br>
This is essentially a search engine DB flat file that<br>
will have a fast way to find code pieces and chunks and methods<br>
based on what they do.<br>
Behaviors are described as actions - Dijkstra's word and <br>
functions. The key is to be able to assemble together serveral<br>
already thought out actions so that time isn't wasted rediscovering<br>
how to do something (express it in code) to create a subtask behavior.<br>
<br>
There will be levels of behaviors in this repository too.
<br>
This is going to be written in JavaScript and  Python.
<br><br>
The general idea is though it will be tag based it will also<br>
have a Literate Programming component ala Don Knuth from Stanford<br>
so that there are different way to reference the knowledge contained<br>
within this Dev Tool.<br>
<br><br>
Edsger Dijkstra wrote in his Turing award lecture that<br>
"we create machine behavior" and Fred Brooks wrote that<br>
the only ways to speed up software development are by using<br>
high level langauges, reusing code, and reducing bugs, and<br>
reduce the curent 70% of time spent thinking and current<br>
time of 50% of develpment on debugging. This is essentially<br>
a searchable Reuse of Code Repository to save time and reduce bugs<br>
so that I can spend more time thinking at the function level<br>
what a function does rather than spending so much time inside<br>
of the function dealing with discovering the golden algorithm design.<br>
